roar-ng II is the next generation of roar-ng, a generic GNU/Linux distribution
building system.

It extends roar-ng's abilities and improves its flexibility. Its main features
are:
 - Support for multiple distributions, architectures and distribution versions
   in parallel, with a high degree of efficiency.
 - A smart plug-in system, which makes it easier to add support for a new
   distribution.
 - Support for installation as a regular package.
 - Support for parallel download of packages.

It is in very early stages of developmenmt; once it matures, it will deprecate
roar-ng.

Currently supported distributions:
  - Debian (http://www.debian.org/) and derivatives:
    - Raspbian (http://www.raspbian.org/)
