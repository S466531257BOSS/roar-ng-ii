# Overview #
############

roar-ng II is a framework for the construction of GNU/Linux distributions. Any
distribution built by:
  - Can run "live", without leaving any traces behind.
  - Can run from pretty much any media (optical media, flash drives, hard
    drives, memory cards and more).
  - Is easy to develop, maintain amd customize.

roar-ng II provides the means for handling the binary packages of various
distributions; all you have to do in order to build a distribution is to specify
the list of packages to include in it; roar-ng II will take care of the rest.

roar-ng II makes it simple and quick to develop your very own GNU/Linux
distribution. Therefore, it saves your precious time and money.

################
# How it Works #
################

roar-ng II has powerful, extensible design: support for each distribution is
provided by a plug-in. Many distributions are supported, in all processor
architectures.

Thanks to this design, the process of building a distribution is quite simple:
  - roar-ng II lists the packages available for each distribution.
  - Each package specified in the package list are downloaded from the
    repositories of a given distribution.
  - All packages are extracted.
  - An image of the distribution is built.

In addition, distributions built by roar-ng II ship with an automated package
building framework, which can be used directly through roar-ng II to
cross-compile packages for distributions built by it.

###########################
# Supported Distributions #
###########################

Distributions currently supported by roar-ng II are:
  - Debian (http://www.debian.org/) and derivatives:
      - Ubuntu (http://www.ubuntu.com/)
      - Linux Mint (http://www.linuxmint.com/)
      - Raspbian (http://www.raspbian.org/)
  - RPM-based distributions:
      - Mageia (http://www.mageia.org/)
      - Fedora (http://fedoraproject.org/)
      - CentOS (https://www.centos.org/)
      - openSUSE (http://www.opensuse.org/)
  - Arch Linux (http://www.archlinux.org/)
  - Slackware (http://www.slackware.com/)
  - Puppy Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/) and derivatives:
      - Slacko
      - Wary (http://www.bkhome.org/wary/)

This means roar-ng II is able to build distributions using packages which
originate in any version of these distributions, for any processor architecture.

#########
# Usage #
#########

A typical roar-ng II session consists of four steps:
  - roar-ng setup   : downloads and processes the package lists of all
                      repositories of distributions specified in the package
                      list.
  - roar-ng download: downloads all packages specified in the package list.
  - roar-ng extract : extractes the downloaded packages.
  - roar-ng build   : builds a bootable image of the distribution; receives two
                      additional command-line arguments: the bootable media type
                      and the output file path.

In addition, roar-ng II exposes some functionality through additional execution
modes:
  - check    : performs sanity checks of the package list.
  - package  : builds a binary package from source, within the distribution;
               must run after "build". In this mode, roar-ng II needs sufficient
               permissions to run mount and chroot.
  - cleanup  : cleans up after "build" by removing intermediate directories.
               Must be used between executions of roar-ng II with "build".

# Subito GNU/Linux-libre #
##########################

Subito GNU/Linux-libre is the flaship distribution built by roar-ng II; the
stock configuration supplied with roar-ng II will always build the latest
version of Subito GNU/Linux-libre.

Subito GNU/Linux-libre is a GNU/Linux-libre distribution for the x86_64
architecture, aimed at advanced users and optimized for console applications,
keyboard control and low consumption of resources.

To build Subito GNU/Linux-libre, simply run roar-ng II:
  roar-ng setup
  roar-ng download
  roar-ng extract
  roar-ng build isolinux output.iso
